        This method first performs a pass of forward propagation through the
        network, then applies the following procedure to calculate the
        gradients. In the following description, × is matrix multiplication,
        ⊙ is element-wise product, and ⊤ is matrix transpose.

        First, calculate the error, error_L, between last layer's activations,
        h_L, and the output matrix, y:

        error_L = h_L - y

        Then, for each layer l in the network, starting with the layer before
        the output layer and working back to the first layer (the input matrix),
        calculate the gradient for the corresponding weight matrix as follows.
        First, calculate g_l as the element-wise product of the error for the
        next layer, error_{l+1}, and the sigmoid gradient of the next layer's
        weighted sum (before the activation function), a_{l+1}.

        g_l = (error_{l+1} ⊙ sigmoid'(a_{l+1}))⊤

        Then calculate the gradient matrix for layer l as the matrix
        multiplication of g_l and the layer's activations, h_l, divided by the
        number of input examples, N:

        grad_l = (g_l × h_l)⊤ / N

        Finally, calculate the error that should be backpropagated from layer l
        as the matrix multiplication of the weight matrix for layer l and g_l:

        error_l = (weights_l × g_l)⊤

        Once this procedure is complete for all layers, the grad_l matrices
        are the gradients that should be returned.

        :param input_matrix: The matrix of inputs to the network, where each

        the expected outputs - each either 0 or 1 - for the corresponding row in
        the input matrix.
